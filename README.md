## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Light JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned to use the Grid layout technology better in practice, I encountered a few problems, which will prevent them from repeating in the future. I spent a lot of time perfecting the look of the site to match the look of the site I was about to recreate.

### Continued development

I'm going to focus more on JavaScript, improve my skills of arranging and managing elements on the page.
